# tidyother

## Overview

This is an R package that I developed for my personal use to make it easier for myself to work with data. However, everyone is welcome to use it if they find it helpful. 

The name "tidyother" implies that I am heavily inspired by the approach implemented in the "tidyverse", but use it in *other* applications.

## Installation

```
library(devtools)
install_github("dtereshch/tidyother")
```

## Usage
```
library(tidyother)

?describe
?describe_by
?describe_panel
?plot_heterog
?plot_unbalanced
?explore_incomplete
?list_incomplete
```
